        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS- Cascading Styling Sheets</li>
          <li>3 Ways to Style CSS- Inline CSS, Internal Style Sheet, and External Style Sheet</li>
          <li>Inline CSS- Used to style an element directly in HTML File. Apply to specific tag using style attribute with a CSS Rule</li>
          <li>Inline Example: (<)h1 style="color:red;"(>)Prework Study Guide(closing tag)</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet- Embeds an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using (<)style(>) element in the (<)head(>) section</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet- Contains rules in head section of HTML file, and rules only apply to that page</li>
          <li>External CSS Style Sheet- MOST COMMON, and allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in separate file, making design changes easier</li>
          <li>External Style Sheet- Have to link the file using a (<)link(>) element placed in the HTML's (<)head(>) section.</li>
          <li>(<)link(>) rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css"</li>
          <li>Link Element- Creates a connection to external file</li>
          <li>rel="stylesheet" attribute- Specifies the relationship between current document and the linked document resource</li>
          <li>href="./assets/style.css"- Specifies the location (URL) of external resource</li>
          <li>Separation of Concerns- Refers to separating code into different files based on use</li>
          <li>Selector- Defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations- contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>Margin- Indicates how much space we want around the OUTSIDE of an element (Not Visible, adds buffer)</li>
          <li>Padding- Property adds space around the content INSIDE an element</li>
          <li>CSS Box Model- Every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, the element's borders, padding, and content</li>
          <li>* Symbol- Used when we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page</li>
          <li>DRY Rule- Do Not Repeat Yourself</li>
          <li>Can combine selectors by using a comma</li>
          <li>Text-align- A way to center a title or heading on a webpage</li>
          <li>img selector- Assigns property values to any image element in markup</li>
          <li>display: block;- Assigns a block value, which assigns each image to start a new line</li>
          <li>Class Selector- a period followed by class name</li>
          <li>Width Attribute- Assigns width (percentage)</li>
          <li>Margin: 40px auto- 40px refers to top/bottom and auto refers to left/right</li>
          <li>Border: 5px solid gray- Width=5px and solid gray</li>
          <li>Box Shadow- Adds shadow effects around an element's frame. Described by X and Y offsets</li>
          <li>Assigning Colors- Can be done using semantic referneces, like gray or blue. Can also be done using hexadecimal code or hex#</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git- A version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project</li>
          <li>GitHub- A cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely. Allows us to easily collaborate with others</li>
          <li>Repository- A folder in which all files and their version histories are stored</li>
          <li>Branch- A workspace in which you can make changes that won’t affect the live site</li>
          <li>Markdown- A way to write in Github that converts plain text to Github code</li>

          <li>Pull Request- Asking for changes on a branch to merge into another branch. Way to discuss and review your work with others</li>
          <li>Merge- After a pull request is approved, the commit will be pulled in (or merged) from one branch to another and then, deployed on the live site</li>
          <li>Issues- How work is tracked when using Git. Issues allow users to report new tasks and content fixes, as well as allows users to track progress on a project board from beginning to end of a specific project</li>

          <li>Feature Branch- When we create a new branch to add something new to our project</li>
          <li>Pull Request (PR)- Used to merge a comparison branch (in our case, the feature branch) into the base branch (in our case, main branch)</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: add command adds modifications in current working branch to staging area. The -A flag indicates we want to add all changes</li>
          <li>git commit -m "commit message": Write commit message that describes what the commit contains (imperative command/present tense), "add starter code"</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: recieve branches modifications in local environment. This makes sure we have the latest version of the project on your local computer</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/starter-code: Replace feature/starter-code with branch name. This pushes from local environment to remote Github Branch</li>
