# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- I was motivated to create this project because it provides easy access to my notes and stores them in an organized fashion. 
- I created this project to help organize and store my prework notes, as well as, help me efficiently study prior to coding camp. 
- It prevents me from having to scroll through pasges and pages of notes, and provides me with just the information I need to focus on studying.
- I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Githhub. Some of which I had prior experience with, but this allowed me to expand my knowledge and learn, firsthand, how to use these coding languages.

## Usage

The website contains notes divided into four different sections: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Each section contains notes pertaining to critical concepts, important keywords, word definitions, and other study concepts. If you open the DevTools console, we can see JavaScript running. It lists all four prework topics and choose one topic to study first, thus allowing us to pick a topic at random to study.
